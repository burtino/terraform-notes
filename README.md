# terraform-notes

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) is a tool to manage infrasrtucture as code from [Hashicorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/).

## tfenv
[tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv) is a terraform version manager inspired by [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv). It makes it easy to operate on different terraform projects and modules of different version compatibility.

## terragrunt
[terragrunt](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt) is a thin wrapper for Terraform that provides extra tools for working with multiple Terraform modules. It can help you re-use more infrastructure code and provides other benefits. Terragrunt comes from by Yevgeniy Brikman and team at [gruntwork](https://gruntwork.io/). He wrote [Terraform up and Running](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920225010.do). 
Gruntwork also created [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest). With terratest you can write automated tests against your infrastructure code.
